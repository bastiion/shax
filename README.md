# shax
A SHAX processor, as well as an RDFe processor. A SHAX processor transforms SHAX models into SHACL, XSD and JSON Schema. It can also transform XSD into SHAX. 
An RDFe processor maps XML documents to RDF triples, guided by semantic map documents.

A command-line tool written in XQuery and based on the TopicTools framework ( https://github.com/hrennau/topictools ).

Documention is under construction. For the time being, please consult doc/shax-quickstart.pdf for getting started.

Use of this tool currently requires the use of the BaseX XQuery processor ( http://basex.org ).
