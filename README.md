# shax
A SHAX processor, transforming SHAX models into SHACL, XSD and JSON Schema. A command-line tool written in XQuery and based on the TopicTools framework ( https://github.com/hrennau/topictools ).

Work in progress - documentation will be added before February 08, 2018 (xmlprague 2018).

Use of this tool currently requires the use of the BaseX XQuery processor ( http://basex.org ).
